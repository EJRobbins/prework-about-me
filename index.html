      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Erica and I currently work full time troubleshooting 
      software and networking issues at a start-up in Lehi. I am a lover of hiking,
    biking, tattoos, and iced coffee. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Salt Lake City, UT</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In the summer, I love to hike, bike, or do anything in nature with
        my dog, Daisy. During the winter I spend my time reading, writing,
        and spinning pottery.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I originally went to school with the intention of being a psychiatrist,
        but quickly learned I do not have the patience for an M.D. degree. As of now,
        I am enjoying technology, and would like to further help push products that
        help people, thus my interest in coding.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Sandy! </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As I said before, I want to be able to help manage, or create a product
        that helps people. 
      </p>
